# Ecommerce--ml-problem\
### A practice notebook where i try to make sense of the  dataset by doing the following:

^ What is the best selling category?
       *Visualize payment method and order status
       *Find correlation between payment method and order status
       *Find a correlation between order date and item category
       *Find any hidden patterns that are counter intuitive for a layman
       *Can we predict number of orders, or item category or number of cusomers/amount in advance
      
 
 The dataset is in the "data" folder. 
 NOTE: the dataset does not belong to me, i got it from kaggle
